Synced with desktop

25 April 2017
Works ok on PC (csv files found)
Added code to update prevPBs but always re-written with None when running python file. Need to either create a loop of some kind or use database
Created database.py to work on db but need to learn Sqlalchemy first : see mycookbook

19 April 2017
Working on classes.py but struggling to even load a csv file!

11 April 2017
Working with csv '3' created dictionary of runners with the first date they ran : runnerdict
This seems now to have created runner objects with correct start dates
next step: add initial times to people


03 April 2017
Created simple list to get user to choose file and assigned answer to sourcefile
Next step: work on adding pb to person objects from first file

01 April 2017
Created dated versions of results
Created function that produces list of files in folders directory
Need to present to user so they can easily choose.

29 March 2017
Updated classes.py
Modified Person class to initialise pbs
Added methods to update them
Created code to call the method

Next step: find a way to do it for real for each runner

22 March 2017
Created classes.py file to work on creting runner class
Finally got it working but now need to add init data like date created.
For now it is default to today but want to be able to at least create function to add date and pb etc.

'''
Building class to store info.
Having problem instantiating from the list of runners
runners = {name: Person(name=name) for name in runner_list} - this seems to work but can't access class functions.
'''

18 March 2017
Added code to find pbs between two races (jan and feb 2015)
Add date parsing to readcsv .
! dayfirst = True !

16 March 2017
Added sorting and minimum values etc.
Need to find a nice way to export to csv

14 March 2017
Added code to select brief or full csv
Also added option to include full excel. Installed xlrd to be able to read from xls file
Trying to sort pbs by runner to see if it is working correctly
Working on jupyter noteboook because this is best way to work with pandas for testing.
Takes time to load.
Need to look at later.

12 March 2017
Refactored 'data' to 'df' to avoid confusion with learning
07 March 2017
Installed Jupyter (upgraded pip first)
Then worked out how to get pbs
Need to understand this!

06 March 2017
Created project.
Used existing file checking from mycookbook to test currency of file
Created list of runners
Next: create dictionary to store pb
also: install jupyter
